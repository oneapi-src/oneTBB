.. _Intro_gsg:


|short_name| is a runtime-based parallel programming model for C++ code that uses threads. 
It enables you to simplify parallel programming by breaking 
computation into parallel running tasks. 
The library consists of a template-based runtime library to help you harness the latent performance
of multi-core processors. Use |short_name| to write scalable applications that:


- Specify logical parallel structure instead of threads
- Emphasize data parallel programming
- Take advantage of concurrent collections and parallel algorithms
