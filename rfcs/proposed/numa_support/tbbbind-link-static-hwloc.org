#+title: Improve predictability of API for NUMA support

*Note:* This is a sub-RFC of the https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/pull/1535.
Specifically, its section about "Increased availability of NUMA support".

* Introduction
oneTBB has a soft dependency on several variants of ~tbbbind~, which are loaded
by the library as part of its initialization stage. In turn, each ~tbbbind~ has
a hard dependency on a concrete version of the HWLOC library [1, 2]. The soft
dependency of oneTBB on ~tbbbind~ allows the library to continue its execution
even if the system loader is unable to resolve the hard dependency on HWLOC for
~tbbbind~. In this case, the HW topology is not discovered and the machine is
seen as if all CPU cores were uniform, which is the default TBB behavior when
NUMA constraints are not used. Thus, the following code returns the values that
do not reflect the real topology and do not matter:

#+begin_src C++
std::vector<oneapi::tbb::numa_node_id> numa_nodes = oneapi::tbb::info::numa_nodes();
std::vector<oneapi::tbb::core_type_id> core_types = oneapi::tbb::info::core_types();
#+end_src

This lack of valid HW topology data due to absence of a third party library is
the major problem with the current oneTBB behavior. There is no diagnostics for
the issue, which likely makes it unnoticeable by developers, and the code that
uses oneTBB NUMA support facilities continues running but does not use NUMA as
intended.

Having a dependency on a shared HWLOC library has advantages:
1. Code reuse with all of the positive consequences out of this, including
   relying on the same code that has been tested and debugged, allowing the OS
   to share it among different processes, which consequently improves on cache
   locality and memory footprint. That's the primary purpose of shared
   libraries.
2. A drop-in replacement. Users are able to use their own version of HWLOC
   without recompilation of oneTBB. This specific version of HWLOC could include
   a hotfix to support a particular and/or new hardware that a customer has, but
   whose support is not yet upstreamed to HWLOC project. It is also possible
   that such support won't be upstreamed at all if that hardware is not going to
   be available for massive users. It could also be a development version of
   HWLOC that someone wants to test on their systems first. Of course, they can
   do it with the static version as well, but that's more cumbersome as it
   requires recompilation of every dependent component.

The only disadvantage from depending on HWLOC library dynamically is that the
developers that use oneTBB's NUMA support API need to make sure the library is
available and can be found by oneTBB. Depending on the distribution model of a
developer's code, this is achieved either by:
1. Asking the end user to have necessary version of a dependency pre-installed.
2. Bundling necessary HWLOC version together with other pieces of a product
   release.

However, the requirement to fulfill one of the above steps for the NUMA API to
start paying off may be considered as an incovenience and, what is more
important, it is not always obvious that one of these steps is needed.
Especially, due to silent behavior in case HWLOC library cannot be found in the
environment.

This proposal suggests an improvement to reduce the effect of the disadvantage
being dependent on a dynamic version of HWLOC library by having it linked
statically with one of the ~tbbbind~ libraries that are distributed together
with oneTBB, yet leaving possibility to specify another version of HWLOC library
if users see the need.

* Proposal
1. Introduce new variant of the ~tbbbind~ library with the name ~tbbbind_static~
   which is linked with a static HWLOC library and distributed along side with
   the other ~tbbbind~ variants.
2. Add loading of ~tbbbind_static~ as the last attempt to resolve the dependency
   on functionality provided by ~tbbbind~ layer.
3. Update the oneTBB documentation considering [[https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneTBB/search.html?q=tbb%3A%3Ainfo][these documentation pages]] to
   include steps determining the variant of ~tbbbind~ being used.

** Advantages
The proposed behavior allows having a mechanism for resolving a dependency on
HWLOC library in case it cannot be found in the environment, while still
preferring user-provided version of HWLOC.

As a result, the problematic use of oneTBB API mentioned above should work as
expected, returning enumerated list of actual NUMA nodes and core types on the
system the code is running on, provided that the loaded HWLOC library works on
that system and that an application properly distributes all binaries of oneTBB,
sets the environment so that the necessary variant of ~tbbbind~ library can be
found and loaded.

** Disadvantages
1. There will be one more variation of a ~tbbbind~ binary to ship in oneTBB
   distribution packages.
2. By default still no diagnostics if users failed to setup environment with
   their own version of HWLOC library correctly. Although, specifying
   ~TBB_VERSION=1~ envar will help identifying an issue with setup of
   environment pretty quickly.

* Alternative handling of inability to parse system topology
The other behavior in case HWLOC library cannot be found is to be more explicit
about the problem of a missing component and to either issue a warning or to
refuse working requiring one of the ~tbbbind~ variant to be loaded (e.g., throw
an exception).

Comparing these alternative approaches to the one proposed.
** Common Advantages
- Explicitly tells that the functionality being used is not going to work
  instead of just being silent.
- Does not require additional variant of ~tbbbind~ library to be distributed
  along with the others.

** Common Disadvantages
- Requires additional step from the user side to resolve the problem. In other
  words, it does not provide complete solution to the problem.

** Disadvantages of Issuing a Warning
- The warning may still not be visible, especially if standard streams are
  closed.

** Disadvantages of Throwing an Exception
- May break existing code as it does not expect an exception to be thrown.
- Requires introduction of an additional exception hierarchy.
