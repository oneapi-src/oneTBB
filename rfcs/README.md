# oneTBB Design Documents/RFCs

The RFC process intends to:

- Communicate library-wide changes
- Collect feedback before implementation
- Increase transparency in decision-making 
- Align different teams involved in oneTBB development

This directory contains design documents (RFCs) approved 
or rejected for implementation in oneTBB.

The possible RFC states are:

1. Initial 
2. Proposed
3. Experimental
4. Supported
5. Archived

Most modifications or new features will naturally start as a part of a 
GitHub issue or discussion. Small changes do not require a formal RFC. 
However, if the issue or discussion results in an idea for a significant 
change or new feature that affects the library's public API or architecture, 
we recommend opening a PR to add a new RFC to the `rfcs/proposed` directory. 
The RFC should provide a detailed description and design of the proposed feature.
or new feature that significantly impacts the library's public API or 
architecture, it will be suggested that a PR be opened to add a new rfc 
to the `rfcs/proposed` directory. The RFC contains a more detailed description
and design for the feature.

## General Process

A template for RFCs is available as [template.md](template.md). Place the modified
template in the subdirectory of the `rfcs/proposed` with a name
of the form `<feature>_<extension_description>`. For example,
a proposal for a new ``my_op`` flow graph node should be put into the
`rfcs/proposed/flow_graph_my_op_node` directory. Use [template.md](template.md) 
to create the `README.md` file in that directory. The folder can 
contain other files referenced by the `README.md` file, such as figures.

Once two maintainers approve the PR, it is merged into the `rfcs/proposed`
directory. Update the RFC document with additional information as the RFC moves 
to different states. 

A proposal that is subsequently implemented and released in oneTBB 
as a preview feature is moved into the `rfcs/experimental` folder. The
RFC for a preview feature in `rfcs/experimental` should include a description
of what is required to move from experimental to fully supported -- for 
example, feedback from users, demonstrated performance improvements, etc.

A proposal that is implemented, added to the oneTBB specification, and 
supported as a full feature appears in the `rfcs/supported` directory. An RFC 
for a fully supported feature in the `rfcs/supported` directory should 
have a link to the section in the oneTBB specification with its 
formal wording.

A feature that is removed or a proposal that is abandoned or rejected will 
be moved to the `rfcs/archived` folder.

## Document Style

The design documents are stored in the `rfcs` directory, and each RFC is placed 
in its subdirectory under `rfcs/proposed/<feature>_<extension_description>`. 

- There must be a `README.md` file that contains the main RFC itself (or 
links to a file that contains it in the same directory).
  - The RFC should follow the [template.md](template.md) structure. 
  - The directory can contain other supporting files, such as images, tex 
  formulas, and sub-proposals / sub-RFCs.
  - We highly recommend using a text-based file format like markdown for easy 
  collaboration on GitHub, but other formats like PDFs may also be acceptable.
    template file for writing RFCs. However, it is strongly recommended to use
    text-based file format that can be rendered by GitHub to allow for easy
    collaboration using PR comments. Even so, files such as pdfs may be
    acceptable.
- For the markdown-written RFC, keep the text width within
  80 characters, unless there is a reason to violate this rule, e.g., 
  long links or wide tables.
- It is also recommended to read through existing RFCs to better understand the 
general writing style and required elements.
