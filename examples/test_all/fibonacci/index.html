<H2>Overview</H2>
This directory contains an example that computes Fibonacci numbers in several
different ways. The purpose of the example is to exercise every include file
and class in Intel&reg; Threading Building Blocks.
Most of the computations are deliberately silly and not expected to
show any speedup on multiprocessors.
<H2>Files</H2>
<DL>

<DD>Contains Microsoft* Visual Studio* 2010 workspace for building and running the 
    example (Windows* systems only).<DT><A HREF="xcode">xcode</A>

<H2>To Build</H2>
General build directions can be found <A HREF=../../index.html#build>here</A>.

<H2>Usage</H2>
<DL>
<DT><TT>fibonacci <I>K</I> [<I>M</I>[:<I>N</I>]] [<I>R</I>]</TT>
<DD>Calculates the <I>K</I>-th fibonacci number.
    <I>M</I> and <I>N</I> are a range of numbers of threads to be used.
    <I>R</I> is the number of times to repeat the calculation.
<DT>To run a short version of this example, e.g., for use with Intel&reg; Threading Tools:
<DD>Build a <I>debug</I> version of the example
    (see the <A HREF=../../index.html#build>build directions</A>).
    <BR>Run it with a small fibonacci number and the desired number of threads, e.g., <TT>fibonacci 100 4</TT>.
