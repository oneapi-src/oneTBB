<H2>Overview</H2>
Parallel raytracer / renderer that demonstrates the use of parallel_for.

<P><I>
This example includes software developed by John E. Stone. See
<A HREF=#copyright>here</A> for copyright information.
</I></P>

<P>
This example is a 2-D raytracer/renderer that visually shows different parallel scheduling
methods and their resulting speedup.  The code was parallelized by speculating
that each pixel could be rendered in parallel.  The resulting parallel code was
then checked for correctness by using Intel&reg; Thread Checker, which
pointed out where synchronization was needed.  Minimal synchronization was then
inserted into the parallel code.  The resulting parallel code exhibits good speedup.
</P>

<P>
The following versions of the example are provided:
<DL>
<DT>serial
<DD>Original sequential version.
<DT>tbb1d
<DD>Parallel version that uses Intel&reg; Threading Building Blocks (Intel&reg; TBB) and blocked_range to parallelize
	over tasks that are groups of scan-lines.
    <UL>
    <LI>By default, this version uses one thread per available processor. To change this
	default, set the TBB_NUM_THREADS environment variable to the desired number of threads before running.
    <LI>This version uses the preview feature: auto_range_partitioner.  No grain size is provided to blocked_range.
        The blocked_range class uses a default grain size of 1 when none is provided.  However, the auto_range_partitioner
        controls the amount of range splitting dynamically at runtime, resulting in sub-ranges of varying sizes.
    </UL>
<DT>tbb
<DD>Parallel version that uses Intel TBB and blocked_range2d to parallelize
	over tasks that are rectangular sub-areas.
    <UL>
    <LI>By default, this version uses one thread per available processor.  To change this
	default, set the TBB_NUM_THREADS environment variable to the desired number of threads before running.
    <LI>This version uses a reasonable task grain size by default.  To change this default,
	set the TBB_GRAINSIZE environment variable to the desired grain size before running.
	The grain size corresponds to the number of pixels (in the X or Y direction, for a
	rectangular sub-area) in each parallel task.

<H2>To Build</H2>
General build directions can be found <A HREF=../../index.html#build>here</A>.

<P>
For Windows* systems Microsoft* Visual Studio* projects are provided for each of the above
    example versions.
</P>

<P>
The Makefile supports the following build targets (in addition to the <A HREF=../../index.html#build>general</A> ones).
Here, &lt;<I>version</I>&gt; is one of the above versions of the example, i.e., {serial, tbb1d, tbb}.
</P>
<DL>
<DT><TT>make &lt;<I>version</I>&gt;[_debug]</TT>
<DD>Build and run a single version (release or debug).
    Equivalent to 'make build_&lt;<I>version</I>&gt;[_debug] run_&lt;<I>version</I>&gt;'.
<DT><TT>make build_&lt;<I>version</I>&gt;[_debug]</TT>
<DD>Compile and link a single version (release or debug).
    The resulting executable is left in the directory for the example.
<DT><TT>make run_&lt;<I>version</I>&gt;</TT>
<DD>Run a single version previously produced by one of the above commands.
<DT><TT>make [(above options or targets)] DATASET={820spheres, balls, balls3, lattice, model2,
    teapot, trypsin4pti}</TT>
<DD>Build and run as above, but run with the specified data set.
<DT><TT>make [(above options or targets)] ARGS=-D</TT>
<DD>Build and run as above, but run with disabled run-time display updating for use in making performance measurements
    <I>(strongly recommended when measuring performance or scalability; see note below)</I>.
<DT><TT>make [(above options or targets)] UI={con, gdi, d2d, x, mac}</TT>
<DD>Build and run as usual, but build with the specified GUI driver: console, GDI+*, Direct2D*, X11, or OpenGL*
	(see the description of the <A HREF=../../common/index.html>common GUI code</A>
	for more information on available graphics support).
    For Linux* and OS X* systems, the best available driver is detected automatically by the Makefile.
    For Windows* systems, UI=gdi is the default GUI driver; compiling with UI=d2d may offer superior
	performance, but can only be used if the Microsoft* DirectX* SDK is installed on your system.
    Use UI=con to build without the GUI for use in making performance measurements
	<I>(strongly recommended when measuring performance or scalability; see note below)</I>.
<DT><TT>make [(above options or targets)] XARCH=x64</TT>
<DD>Build and run as above, but
    also specify XARCH=x64 (or XARCH=AMD64 for older compilers) when building the example on Windows* as a 64-bit binary.
<DT><TT>make [(above options or targets)] DDLIB_DIR=&lt;<I>specify path to library directory of Direct Draw* SDK here</I>&gt;</TT>
<DD>If you experience ddraw.lib linking problems, specify the correct library directory via this option.
</DL>

<H2>Usage</H2>
Building via the above make commands, or via Visual Studio projects on Windows* systems, produces executable files
named <TT>tachyon.&lt;<I>version</I>&gt;.exe</TT>.  To run these executables directly, use one or more of the following commands.
<DL>
<DT><TT>tachyon.&lt;<I>version</I>&gt; <I>-h</I></TT>
<DD>Prints the help for command line options
<DT><TT>tachyon.&lt;<I>version</I>&gt; [<I>dataset</I>=value] [<I>boundthresh</I>=value] [<I>no-display-updating</I>] [<I>nobounding</I>] [<I>silent</I>]</TT>
<DT><TT>tachyon.&lt;<I>version</I>&gt; [<I>dataset</I> [<I>boundthresh</I>]] [<I>no-display-updating</I>] [<I>nobounding</I>] [<I>silent</I>]</TT>
<DD><I>dataset</I> is the path/name of one of the *.dat files in the <A HREF="dat">dat</A> directory for the example.<BR>
    <I>boundthresh</I> is a bounding threshold value.<BR>
    <I>no-display-updating</I> - disable run-time display updating.<BR>
    <I>no-bounding</I> - disable bounding technique.<BR>
    <I>silent</I> - no output except elapsed time.<BR>
<DT><TT>tachyon.&lt;<I>version</I>&gt; [<I>dataset</I>] [<I>no-display-updating</I>]</TT>
<DD>Run this version (release or debug), but run with disabled run-time display updating
    for use in making performance measurements
    <I>(strongly recommended when measuring performance or scalability; see note below)</I>.
<DT>To run a short version of this example, e.g., for use with Intel&reg; Parallel Inspector:
<DD>Build a <I>debug</I> version of the <TT>tbb</TT> example with the GUI turned off
    (e.g., <TT>make UI=con tbb_debug</TT>; see also the build directions above).
    <BR>Run it with a small dataset, e.g., <TT>tachyon.tbb.exe dat/820spheres.dat no-display-updating</TT>.
</DL>

<H2>Keys</H2>
While running with the GUI display turned on the following keyboard keys can be used:
<DL>
<DT><TT>ESC</TT>
<DD>Interrupt the rendering and exit
<DT><TT><I>Any key</I></TT>
<DD>Enable repetition of rendering after the pause. Press ESC to stop the application.
<DT><TT>Space</TT>
<DD>Toggle run-time display updating mode while rendering (see no-display-updating above).
<DT><TT>p</TT>
<DD>Holds the picture after rendering completion. Press 'p' again to continue.
</DL>

<H2>Notes</H2>
<UL>
<LI>While running with the GUI display turned on should yield reasonable performance in most cases, <I>running with the GUI
    display turned off is strongly recommended</I> in order to demonstrate the full performance and scalability of the example.
