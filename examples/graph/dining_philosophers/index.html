<H2>Overview</H2>
The Dining Philosophers problem demonstrates tbb::flow and the use of the reserving join node to
solve the potential deadlock.
<br>This program runs some number of philosophers in parallel, each thinking and then waiting for chopsticks
to be available before eating.  Eating and thinking are implemented with sleep().  The chopstick positions are represented by a queue_node with one item.
